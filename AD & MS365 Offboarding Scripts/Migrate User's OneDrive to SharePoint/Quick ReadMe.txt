This script does work but I still consider it in a beta state as there are still a number of things I want to do to clean it up.

ðŸ”‘ Key Prerequisits before running the script:
	â€¢ Powershell 7
	â€¢ PnP.Powershell Module (script installs if not detected -- "-scope CurrentUser")
	â€¢ Assumes you've configured an 'App Registration' for the PnPOnline module with Certificate-Based Authentication
		(If you haven't set this up I'll see what I can do to do a write up on the process but it's pretty easy and very Google-able)


Again, I'm sorry for the lack of documentation as it is very late and I am very tired and hungry.
